# instant-web-app
scripts to stand up various web app stacks. 

Curently only a php-fpm nginx and mysql stack is good to go, which is makitFixit.
Put the folder in a the home directory of a ubuntu machine and run "makit.sh 'fqdn' 'mysqlPassword'" with elevated privelage.
It only creates self signed certs so its not suitable for deployment.
